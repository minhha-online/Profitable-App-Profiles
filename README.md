## Project Summary
In this project, I analyzed app data from both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store to uncover insights about the mobile app marketplace. The objective was to identify factors influencing app success, compare characteristics across platforms, and provide recommendations for app development strategies.

This analysis can help developers, marketers, and investors understand key trends to make informed business decisions in the mobile application industry.

- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)

## Dataset Information
- **Apple App Store Data:** *AppleStore.csv*
- **Google Play Store Data:** *googleplaystore.csv*
  
Both datasets contain information on app category, ratings, size, number of installs, price, and more.

## Key Analysis Points
- Distribution of app categories and their popularity
- Relationship between app ratings, size, and price
- Free vs. paid apps: download patterns and trends
- Differences in app characteristics between the two platforms

- Games and Entertainment categories are the most saturated.
- Larger app size does not always correlate with better ratings.
- There are notable differences in the pricing and review patterns between App Store and Google Play apps.
